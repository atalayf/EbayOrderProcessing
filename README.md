# EbayOrderProcessing

I've been using this code for my business daily.
I use 3rd party shipping provider to print labels for ebay orders. 
This code organizes the downloaded orders, collects the orders that are going to the same address to save on shipping charges. 
This code uses "Custom Label" field to identify the items.

# EbayOrderProcessing

I've been using this code for my business daily. <br/>
I use 3rd party shipping provider to print labels for ebay orders. <br/>
This code organizes the downloaded orders, collects the orders that are going to the same address to save on shipping charges. <br/>
This code uses "Custom Label" field to identify the items.<br/>
